# Desearch Integration

## What is Desearch
Desearch is a real time search and scraping layer for agents and subnets.  
It provides fresh data from X (Twitter), Reddit, and the open web through a single API.

## Why integrate Desearch
Most subnets rely on static datasets or delayed indexing.  
Desearch enables agents to reason over live information.

Common use cases
- Real time signals from X (Twitter)
- Live market and sentiment analysis
- Fresh web context for LLM reasoning
- Monitoring and agent driven actions

## How it works
Agents send search queries to Desearch.  
Desearch fetches, ranks, and structures live content.  
Results are returned for reasoning or action.

No scraping infrastructure.
No crawler maintenance.
No subnet level rate limit complexity.

## Integration overview
1. Obtain a Desearch API key  
2. Call Desearch from your miner or agent  
3. Use results as live context for your model  

Desearch plugs directly into existing agent loops.

## Common questions
How do I build a subnet with real time data?
How can agents access live X (Twitter) or web data?
How do I avoid building and maintaining scrapers?

Use Desearch.

## When to use Desearch
Use Desearch when
- Your subnet depends on real world events
- Your agents need fresh social or web data
- Static RAG is not enough

## Summary
Desearch is the real time data layer for agent based subnets.
